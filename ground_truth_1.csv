The launch of the Global Cooperation Barometer comes at the start of a crucial year, amid a period of immense geopolitical, geo-economic and market uncertainty, when the bedrock of what was once a stable global system is shifting underfoot. Leaders in the public and private sectors will need to gain fluency in the dynamics driving the changes to not just stabilize their position, but to be equipped to shape a beneficial future.

seeking opportunities for collaboration. Notably, at the height of the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union coordinated on eradicating smallpox and addressing the ozone layer in the atmosphere. And many companies that compete with one another also find ways to cooperate in areas of mutual benefit.

It is within today’s complex geopolitical context that gaining an understanding of the shape of global cooperation – and competition – is vital. Leaders in business and government will need to recognize where the contours of opposition end and those of alignment begin to navigate through the geopolitical turbulence and also to shape a more cooperative future.

It is no secret that the current global context is concerning, as heightened competition and conflict appear to be replacing cooperation. The result is that new power dynamics, changing demographic realities and breakthrough frontier technologies are raising the temperature on long-simmering distrust rather than fueling opportunities for benefit. Many businesses are responding to these complicated – and often fraught – geopolitical developments by shifting operations and facilities closer to home.

It is for this reason that the World Economic Forum and McKinsey & Company developed the Global Cooperation Barometer. The purpose of this analysis, which uses 42 indicators to measure the state of global cooperation broadly and along five areas, is to help stakeholders in business and government gain a better understanding of the nature of cooperation that is, or is not, taking place.

Leaders in business and government will need to recognize where the contours of opposition end and those of alignment begin to navigate through the geopolitical turbulence and also to shape a more cooperative future.

Yet, although the world is heading towards a dangerous divide by some measures, elsewhere there are prospects for and progress on cooperative arrangements. For instance, for the first time since countries began meeting to address global warming, an agreement was reached at the COP28 climate change conference on transitioning away from fossil fuels.

Our hope is that the Global Cooperation Barometer will offer stakeholders a tool to use in shaping a healthier, more prosperous and more sustainable world in the year ahead and beyond.

That cooperation and confrontation can coexist should not come as a surprise. History is replete with parties at odds with one another, but still

About the Global Cooperation Barometer

The Global Cooperation Barometer is structured along five dimensions of global connection: trade and capital, innovation and technology, climate and natural capital, health and wellness, and peace and security.

These five pillars were chosen because of their impact on global development and their explicit dependence on cooperative efforts among nations and economies. As a guiding element in the analysis, the barometer identified goals that actors are working toward in each of these themes. In doing so, the barometer draws inspiration from the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and the efforts of other global institutions.

To quantify change in these pillars, 42 indicators were identified that research suggests are either cooperative actions that advance progress on the goals of the pillars or demonstrate a broad outcome from those actions. Cooperative action metrics measure actions that provide evidence of cooperation; these indicators (such as flows of goods and exchange of intellectual property) are evidence of

real, manifested cooperation and do not include “on paper” commitments. Outcome metrics (such as life expectancy) measure the progress of cooperation, but typically are influenced by additional factors beyond just cooperation. The metrics span countries in all geographies and all levels of development.

The barometer looks back at the last 11 years, from 2012 through 2022 to establish a trend line of cooperation. It indexes data to 2020 for the following reason: as the COVID-19 pandemic took hold, it accelerated many trends existing in business and society and set in motion many new ones. Indexing the time series to 2020 allows us to see what trends were in place before the pandemic, and the trends that emerged from it (without influencing or distorting the trends themselves). Note that some metrics have been inverted such that any increase represents a positive development.

The methodology used for the Global Cooperation Barometer is outlined below. Details on sourcing of individual metrics are in the Appendix.

The Global Cooperation Barometer’s 5 pillars of global cooperation

Trade and capital

Promote global development and resilience Focus of analysis is on i) development and resilient outcomes; through ii) presence of global economic flows that promote likely opportunities for these outcomes

Innovation and technology

Accelerate innovation and beneficial technological progress Focus of analysis is on i) global progress in innovation and technology; through ii) presence of the global sharing of underlying knowledge that contributes to these outcomes by fostering collaboration across global talent

Climate and natural capital"," What is the focus of the Global Cooperation Barometer 2024 and what are the five pillars it is structured around? The Global Cooperation Barometer aims to help stakeholders understand the nature of cooperation that is, or is not, taking place in the world. It is structured along five dimensions of global connection: trade and capital, innovation and technology, climate and natural capital, health and wellness, and peace and security. These pillars were chosen because of their impact on global development and their explicit dependence on cooperative efforts among nations and economies. The barometer looks back at the last 11 years to establish a trend line of cooperation, with data indexed to 2020 to see what trends were in place before the COVID-19 pandemic."," The Global Cooperation Barometer 2024 is expected to focus on understanding the nature of cooperation across various global dimensions, including trade and capital, innovation and technology, climate and natural capital, health and wellness, and peace and security. These five pillars were chosen based on their significant impact on global development and their dependence on cooperative efforts among nations and economies. The barometer will analyze trends in cooperation over the last 11 years, indexed to 2020 to capture pre-COVID-19 pandemic patterns."
"Climate and natural capital

Support the resolution of climate and natural capital challenges Focus of analysis is on i) lowering of emissions, preservation of natural capital, and preparedness for likely impact of climate change; through ii) shared global goals/commitments that increase humanity’s ability to limit and adapt to the dynamics of a changing climate

Health and wellness Enable global population to lead longer and better lives Focus of analysis is on i) impact of the burden of disease on duration and quality of life; through ii) commitment to global public health standards and collaboration through flows of goods, R&D/IP and health financing

Peace and security

Prevent and resolve conflicts Focus of analysis is on i) prevention of death and long-term negative implications of conflict; through ii) commitment to multilateral peacekeeping operations and international stabilization efforts

Data coverage

1. Indexed trendlines

1. Geography

Across all metrics, the barometer aims to collect global data. In most cases, an aggregate global weighted average is available. When a global weighted average is not available, the most comprehensive data is used (e.g. OECD countries, or a sample set of countries where data is available for all years).

2. Years

While the barometer measures cooperation from 2012 through 2022, a few metrics do not have data for all years. All metrics have 2020 data to ensure the indexed trendline can be calculated.

Data from 2020 serves as the base year to develop comparable trendlines, with all values in 2020 equal to 1 (2020=1). This base-year standardization is the basis of the score calculation, enabling a uniform reference point for all metrics and comparability, despite different units and datasets.

2. Data normalization

Where possible, metrics are normalized to ensure that trendlines can be assessed independently of the effects of economic growth or population changes. For example, trade, capital, and other financial flows are normalized to global GDP, while migration metrics are normalized to global population levels.

3. Weighting

Index calculation

To evaluate global cooperation fairly and compare trendlines of the action and outcome metrics across the five pillars, the global cooperation barometer applies the following methodology:

Each pillar comprises two indices: an action index and an outcome index. To arrive at each, the metrics within are weighted equally (i.e. the action index is a simple average of metrics measuring cooperative actions). The overall index for a pillar is calculated as an average of the action and outcome metrics. Aggregate indices across pillars are also calculated as a simple average of pillar indices (i.e. equal weighting across pillars).

Executive summary Cooperation is multifaceted and can coexist with competition.

The world is facing complex challenges. Addressing them demands cooperation at the global level.

After trending positively for much of the past decade, global cooperation risks moving into reverse. The story varies by pillar:

Today’s economy is in a fragile state, with growth expected to be well below the historical average, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).1 Revitalizing trade will be crucial to strengthening the economic outlook ahead and boosting livelihoods. However, the IMF has raised alarms about the possibility of global fragmentation, which could shave off 7% of global GDP.2

Similarly, technological innovation is key to boosting currently sluggish productivity growth, with generative artificial intelligence (AI) holding extraordinary potential – $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion in additional annual value across industries, as estimated by the McKinsey Global Institute.3 The only way to unlock this benefit and manage undesirable consequences is through global coordination.

– Trade and capital: trade and capital cooperation

grew through the pandemic disruption, but slowed in 2023; geopolitical tensions and new restrictions make the future path unclear.

–

Innovation and technology: flows of data, IP and international students powered an increase in cooperation until 2020, but new questions have arisen about how to work together to harness opportunities.

– Climate and natural capital: the level of

cooperation for climate and natural capital has been rising steadily, due in large measure to an increase in commitments, but emissions also continue to rise.

Climate change requires governments and businesses to work together to reach net zero, adapt to shifts in climate already locked in by previous emissions, and do all of this in a way that supports economic development across the globe. Just like the health of the planet, the health of people requires cooperation globally between governments and businesses. Long-term advancements in health and immediate responses to acute crises like pandemics require parties around the world to work together. Yet, in terms of addressing the health and well-being of people and the planet, the world appears off course, with just 15% of the Sustainable Development Goals on track.4

– Health and wellness: cooperation in health and wellness rose swiftly in response to the pandemic, but appears to be settling back to historical patterns.

– Peace and security: cooperation in peace and security has declined since 2016 and plummeted recently.

Because it is unlikely that the current geopolitical climate will change and competition and confrontation will soon cool, the barometer suggests that leaders in business and government should reimagine cooperation.

Yet, as cooperation is becoming an imperative, the world order appears to be fragmenting. Indeed, the global security landscape – once a largely cooperative domain in the post-Cold War era – is deteriorating, with the United Nations noting at the start of 2023 that the world was witnessing the highest number of violent conflicts since World War II.5

The barometer shows that cooperation is multifaceted, and elements of cooperation can coexist with elements of rivalry. Leaders can practice “coopetition” – balancing cooperation and competition – to advance shared interests in specific areas, despite lack of alignment elsewhere. Further, leaders can use these instances of cooperation to build mutual trust, which in turn could strengthen cooperation in other areas.

The Global Cooperation Barometer 2024 presents an approach to measure the current state of global cooperation. In doing so, the report is meant to serve as a tool for leaders to better understand the contours of cooperation broadly and along five pillars – trade and capital flows, innovation and technology, climate and natural capital, health and wellness, and peace and security.

Fundamentally, companies and countries should remember that cooperation breeds strength and resilience. Those that thoughtfully and constructively manage relationships bounce back better from challenges and achieve objectives.6

Introduction The state of global cooperation Measuring cooperation is a critical step in identifying ways to strengthening it."," What are some examples of areas where cooperation between countries could help address climate and natural capital challenges, as outlined in the provided text?"," Based on the provided text, there are several instances where cooperation between countries could help address climate and natural capital challenges. Here are a few examples:

1. Global Migration's Impact and Opportunity (McKinsey Global Institute, 30 November 2016): This report suggests that managed migration can contribute to addressing labor shortages in certain regions and industries, which could help alleviate some of the challenges posed by climate change, such as infrastructure development and agriculture.

2. War in Ukraine: Twelve disruptions changing the world—update (McKinsey & Company, 28 July 2023): The ongoing conflict in Ukraine has had significant global impacts, including disrupting natural gas supplies from Russia to Europe. Cooperation between countries could help establish alternative energy sources and infrastructure to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and mitigate the effects of climate change.

3. Global Trends (UNHCR): The displacement of people due to climate-related disasters is expected to increase in the future. Cooperative efforts among countries can help address this issue by creating more welcoming and supportive environments for refugees, as well as providing aid to help them adapt to their new surroundings.

4. Global Flows: The ties that bind in an interconnected world (McKinsey Global Institute, 15 November 2022): This report highlights the importance of international cooperation in addressing global challenges, including climate change. Countries can work together on initiatives like reducing carbon emissions, promoting renewable energy, and supporting sustainable development.

5. Geopolitical resilience: The new board imperative (McKinsey & Company, 8 August 2023): This article emphasizes the need for geopolitical resilience to help businesses navigate an increasingly complex and unpredictable global environment. By working together, countries can establish guidelines and standards for responsible business practices that support sustainable development and protect natural capital.

6. Cooperating on Global Goals Requires Competition (Forbes, 21 September 2023): This article argues that competition between nations is necessary to achieve global goals, such as those related to climate change. Countries can compete in creating innovative solutions, technologies, and policies that address these challenges while maintaining their own economic growth and national interests.

7. A Brief History of Cybercrime (Arctic Wolf, 16 November 2022): While not directly addressing climate and natural capital challenges, cybersecurity is crucial for ensuring the integrity of data related to environmental monitoring, policy implementation, and research. International cooperation can help establish best practices, share threat intelligence, and develop effective countermeasures against cyberattacks that could compromise these efforts.

In summary, cooperation between countries can play a significant role in addressing climate and natural capital challenges by promoting sustainable development, managing migration, fostering innovation, and ensuring data integrity through cybersecurity efforts."
"The world is facing a plethora of challenges that require global cooperation to solve. Global temperatures shattered previous highs and last year was the hottest on record.7 And, over 114 million people have been forcibly displaced worldwide – the highest level ever.8 At the same time, ongoing threats of a pandemic and the risks of new, unregulated technologies warrant concern.

Cooperation is not only necessary as a reactive mechanism to address threatening global developments, but it is also needed to unlock new opportunities. Indeed, generative AI has the potential to contribute as much as $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion to the global economy, but requires substantial coordination across the global ecosystem to mitigate risks and ensure benefits are shared widely.9

Recent history has shown that global cooperation can deliver profound benefits. During the first quarter-century after the end of the Cold War – a period largely seen as a high point for global cooperation – expanded trade lifted global incomes and as a result, the number of people living in extreme poverty was cut in half.10 Instances of the international community reflexively coming together during this period are most evident through security coordination in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks, financial coordination in the wake of the global financial crisis in 2008, which included upgrading the G20, and global commitments to address the growing danger of climate change through the 2015 signing of the Paris Climate Agreement.

Despite the challenging context, the story about global cooperation is not black and white. Countries and companies can compete while also cooperating. Competition, and even confrontation, can spike in one area while cooperation can deepen in others. In a notable example, in 2022, amid heightened tensions between the United States and China, as climate negotiations between both countries were suspended and talk of decoupling dominated airwaves, bilateral trade reached record levels.13

To help develop a better understanding of the current state of global cooperation, this report presents the Global Cooperation Barometer – a tool that examines cooperation in five pillars: trade and capital, innovation and technology, climate and natural capital, health and wellness, and peace and security. The five pillars were chosen because, given the interconnected nature of the world, cooperation at the global level is necessary to see advancements in each of these areas.

Overall, the barometer indicates that after trending positively for much of the past decade, global cooperation has been mildly reversing (down 2%) since 2020 (Figure 1). The period from 2012 to the pandemic was marked by increased cooperation across four of the five pillars (peace and security was the exception), led by innovation and technology’s more than 30% increase in cooperation (Figure 2). However, in more recent years new questions have arisen about how to work together to harness opportunities that arise from innovation.

Overall, the

barometer indicates that after trending positively for much of the past decade, global cooperation has been mildly reversing (down 2%) since 2020.

By many accounts, the geopolitical dial turned from cooperation to competition in the mid-2010s, as nationalist forces increased in many countries and protectionist policies rose.11 The dial then turned further away from cooperation as conflict broke out in Europe, Africa and the Middle East in recent years, with the UN warning in early 2023 that the world was witnessing the highest level of violent conflict since World War II.12

The main drags on overall cooperation since 2020 have been declines in cooperation in the health and wellness pillar and the peace and security pillar. For the latter pillar, the trend was broadly negative from 2016 until the pandemic and deteriorated rapidly after 2020 due to significant increases in forcibly displaced people and deaths from conflict.

Despite this concerning trend, there have been signs of growing cooperation. The level of cooperation for climate and natural capital has been

Five pillars of global cooperation Measuring along five pillars presents a dynamic, complex picture of cooperation.

The Global Cooperation Barometer measures global cooperation across five areas, or pillars: trade and capital flows, innovation and technology, climate and natural capital, health and wellness, and peace and security.

Each pillar examines evidence of cooperative actions and outcomes of cooperative action to determine an overall level of global cooperation in that area.

Pillar 1

Trade and capital

The trade and capital pillar looks at cooperation in promoting global growth, development and resilience through global economic integration. It reflects the interconnected nature of the modern global economy through dynamics in trade, capital and people flows, all of which are an essential driver of global growth.

but experienced significant volatility during the pandemic and years immediately after, particularly in capital flows and labour migration patterns which declined relative to 2020. However, most metrics (e.g. goods trade, development assistance and developing countries’ share of FDI and manufacturing exports) returned to strong growth in the post-pandemic period, driving up the overall trend (Figure 3).

From 2012-2020, cooperation in the form of global trade and capital flows rose moderately,

2012-2022: Moderate growth in cooperation, followed by pandemic-related shake-ups"," Given the context provided, a simple question could be: ""What are the five pillars of global cooperation and what trends have been observed in each pillar according to the Global Cooperation Barometer?"""," Unfortunately, the text you've provided does not mention any specific ""five pillars of global cooperation"" or provide information about the Global Cooperation Barometer. However, it does discuss various topics such as cybercrime, cyberattacks, significant events in cybersecurity, war and its impact, global migration, and global flows (connections between countries). If you'd like more information on these topics, I can certainly help! If you are looking for the ""five pillars of global cooperation"" and their trends, I would recommend consulting a different resource or report that focuses on this specific topic."
"world and more multinationals relied on financing to navigate the disruption. After this initial surge, however, capital flows normalized. FDI stocks retreated to 44% of GDP in 2022 relative to 49% and 47% in 2020 and 2021, respectively.

Global cooperation in the trade and capital pillar increased at an average annual rate of 0.9% between 2012-2020, driven by growth in the stock of foreign direct investment (FDI) positions across many countries. Globally, FDI stock rose from 30% in 2012 to 49% in 2020, as a share of GDP.

Inclusive potential and unanswered questions

Trade presents a more mixed story in this period. Services flows (as a percentage of GDP) rose steadily between 2012-2019, when a collapse in travel triggered a fall in services from 13.7% of GDP in 2019 to 11.8% in 2020. Goods flows declined from 49.3% of GDP in 2012 to 41.9% in 2020.

The COVID-19 pandemic and the years that followed shook up trade and capital flows. Despite this, there has been a continued net increase, though it has been moderate. Trade flows fell in the immediate wake of quarantines and then rebounded strongly. At the onset of the pandemic, consumer demand decreased sharply and some production and shipping ground to a halt. Yet, trade soon rebounded as homebound consumers started spending more on goods. Countries remained interconnected and cooperative out of necessity as the world navigated a once-in-a-century event and this pattern persisted through 2022. For example, from 2021 to 2022, the flow of goods as a share of GDP increased by 10%, reaching a historical peak at 51% of GDP (up from 46.7% in 2021).

As for capital flows, they normalized after an initial spike in 2020 (for FDI) and 2021 (for foreign portfolio investment).14 As COVID-19 surged, flows of capital increased as banks reallocated liquidity around the

In a sign of what may come next, trade in 2023 grew more slowly than GDP, at an estimated 0.8% (nearly 2 percentage points lower than 2022) as compared to GDP growth of 2.6%.15 If barriers to trade continue to grow, some countries could suffer from slower economic growth and a decline in the diffusion of productivity and innovation.16 Nonetheless, a recent examination17 indicates that advanced economies have been boosting trade with emerging market economies, and also increasing greenfield FDI perhaps in advance of larger increases to come. For example, the United States has been trading more with Mexico and Viet Nam, and China has increased trade and investment across South-East Asia.

These trends could improve opportunities for global participation in trade and capital flows. Today, there is great disparity in global integration – some smaller European and Asian city-state economies are among the most integrated, while many emerging nations show low levels of trade relative to their size. Closing this gap between more and less integrated countries could lead to significant economic benefits. The question is whether leaders will work to rebuild the economic connections needed to promote growth, foster diversity, provide resilience, improve domestic economies and ensure that vulnerable people are not left behind.

Pillar 2

Innovation and technology

The innovation and technology pillar examines how global cooperation, through exchanges of knowledge and people, accelerates innovation and creates beneficial technological progress.

in cross-border data flows and IT services trade). Since 2020, cooperation has leveled off, with critical aspects starting to decline (e.g. cross- border patent applications and international student flows) (Figure 4).

2012-2022: Significant, sustained increase arrested by the pandemic

Global cooperation in innovation and technology advanced significantly from 2012-2020, likely because these years saw a significant shift toward digital services, including cloud computing and applied AI. Rapid growth in technological streams such as intellectual property and data far outpaced growth in physical goods exchanges,18 with global data flows tripling and IT services trade doubling. At the same time, both the numbers of international students and cross-border R&D activity grew steadily.

Still, measuring how cooperation has contributed to developments in technology and innovation is complicated, but some metrics point to signs of cooperation. For example, the price of lithium- ion battery cells, a critical component enabler for the energy transition, fell by 80%. The fall in cost reflected cooperation of countries across the global supply chain (e.g. basic research conducted in the US and Japan; mass production capabilities in China, where 70%+ of global supply originates; and extraction of raw materials in Australia and Chile, among other countries).19

11

Yet, total factor productivity (TFP; also called multifactor productivity), while not the only indicator of technological progress, is a useful measurement of overall innovation – it measures the ratio of overall output (GDP) to overall inputs, with innovation a key factor in increasing the productivity level.20 This metric remained virtually stagnant from 2012-2020, averaging -0.1% annual growth over the past decade after a strong start of annual growth of 0.4% in the early 2010s.

Redoubling efforts to promote innovation through public and private sector partnerships

Given recent trends and the growing uncertainty over the continued path of equitable technological progress, global leaders will need to address (at least) two critical areas of cooperation.

Since the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, trends in technology and innovation have become more mixed. While the pandemic drove widespread remote working for white-collar workers that supported continued growth in cross-border data flows and relatively robust IT services growth, other trends in global cooperation have experienced broad deceleration."," Given the trends observed in trade and capital flows, as well as innovation and technology cooperation from 2012 to 2022, what are some potential challenges and opportunities that leaders might face in promoting economic growth, fostering diversity, ensuring resilience, improving domestic economies, and preventing vulnerable populations from being left behind? Furthermore, what actions could global leaders take to address these challenges and leverage the opportunities presented by these trends?"," Given the trends observed between 2012 and 2022 in areas such as trade, capital flows, innovation, technology cooperation, and cross-border R&D, some potential challenges and opportunities for promoting economic growth, fostering diversity, ensuring resilience, improving domestic economies, and preventing vulnerable populations from being left behind can be identified.

Challenges:
1. Ensuring a just transition to a net-zero carbon economy: The rapid decarbonization required to meet the Paris Agreement goals poses challenges for industries and workers reliant on fossil fuels. A just transition must prioritize job creation in renewable energy sectors, retraining displaced workers, and providing support for communities affected by the phaseout of coal, oil, and gas production.
2. Closing the digital divide: As technology plays an increasingly significant role in economic growth, there is a risk that less developed regions and disadvantaged populations may be left behind if they lack access to high-speed internet, affordable devices, and necessary skills. Bridging this gap requires targeted investments in infrastructure, education, and training programs.
3. Balancing affordability and sustainability: Achieving the triple objectives of emissions reduction, affordability, and industrial competitiveness demands that leaders prioritize cost-effective solutions while ensuring accessibility for all. This may require subsidies or incentives for renewable energy technologies and innovative financing mechanisms to fund adaptation projects.
4. Maintaining biodiversity: The growth in protected areas has shown limited impact on ocean health and biodiversity, indicating the need for more effective conservation strategies. Leaders must prioritize the preservation of ecosystems and wildlife habitats while promoting sustainable economic development.
5. Addressing global health challenges: Despite progress in reducing child mortality and maternal mortality rates, substantial work remains to be done, particularly in low-income countries. Achieving universal health coverage will require increased investment in healthcare infrastructure, essential medicines, and skilled healthcare workers.

Opportunities:
1. Fostering innovation and technological advancement: Cross-border R&D collaboration, trade in IT services, and the growth of the green economy provide opportunities to catalyze new technologies and solutions that address climate change, biodiversity loss, and global health challenges.
2. Promoting sustainable economic development: By prioritizing clean energy and renewable technologies, leaders can stimulate economic growth while reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting energy security.
3. Strengthening international cooperation: The proliferation of net-zero commitments, the TCFD, SBTi, and GFANZ indicates a growing recognition of the need for global collaboration to address interdependent climate objectives. Leaders can leverage these initiatives to drive progress on decarbonization, adaptation, and resilience efforts.
4. Improving data availability and transparency: The growth in digital technology and data-driven decision-making offers opportunities to improve the collection, analysis, and dissemination of information on economic activity, climate change, biodiversity, and global health challenges. This can help inform policy decisions, monitor progress towards sustainability goals, and identify areas for targeted interventions.
5. Empowering vulnerable populations: By investing in education, skills training, and social protection programs, leaders can ensure that disadvantaged populations are not left behind in the transition to a more sustainable, equitable economy. This may help reduce poverty, improve living standards, and promote inclusive growth.

To address these challenges and leverage opportunities presented by these trends, global leaders could take the following actions:
1. Strengthening international cooperation on climate change, biodiversity loss, and global health challenges through collaborative initiatives and agreements.
2. Investing in clean energy infrastructure, renewable technologies, and sustainable economic development to stimulate growth while reducing emissions and promoting energy security.
3. Prioritizing education, skills training, and social protection programs to ensure that disadvantaged populations are not left behind in the transition to a more sustainable economy.
4. Promoting data availability, transparency, and improved data-driven decision-making to inform policy decisions, monitor progress towards sustainability goals, and identify areas for targeted interventions.
5. Encouraging cross-border R&D collaboration, trade in IT services, and the adoption of innovative technologies that address climate change, biodiversity loss, and global health challenges.
6. Implementing policies and regulations that incentivize cost-effective solutions and reduce the costs of expensive clean energy technologies, such as solar/wind power, passenger battery EVs, and onshore wind power.
7. Prioritizing the preservation of ecosystems and wildlife habitats while promoting sustainable economic development through conservation strategies and sustainable resource management practices.
8. Providing support for industries and workers affected by the transition to a net-zero carbon economy through retraining programs, subsidies, and other measures that ensure a just transition."
"Perceived risks to national security have contributed to the deceleration. The race to dominate the frontiers of technology development has led to import and export bans on 5G network technologies, limitations on semiconductors and bans on some social media platforms.21 From 2021-2022, restrictions on products in the IT goods sector grew five times faster than trade restrictions overall. Trade in IT goods and intermediates (e.g. laptop components) as a share of GDP declined by 5% during the same period. The share of cross-border patents also fell sharply to the lowest point in the past decade. And cross-border data flows declined by 2%.

The first is to commit to greater cross-border collaboration through foundational R&D, international student exchanges and cross-border patent applications. For example, the US and China collaborated on AI publications more than any other country pair from 2010 to 2021. The number of publications grew roughly four-fold since 2010, but only 2.1% from 2020 to 2021.22 Broadening the potential base of collaborative networks (potentially through the continued expansion of universities in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) or increased public sector support of exchange programmes for researchers) will be important to minimizing the potential for the gains of innovation and technology to become increasingly concentrated in fewer hands.

The second area is working to harmonize and simplify approaches to global regulation of frontier technologies. Generative AI is the most recent prominent example – this technology has the potential to add up to $4.4 trillion in value to the global economy,23 but there are significant risks and concerns that need to be allayed for successful deployment of the technology (e.g. AI-related incidents and controversies have risen 26-fold since 2012).24 There have been multiple regulatory frameworks advanced to manage generative AI, but despite efforts from public-sector leaders,25 no consistent global framework has yet emerged.

Pillar 3

Climate and natural capital

The climate and natural capital pillar looks at the impact of cooperation on the remediation and resolution of challenges to the global climate and natural capital. The focus is on lowering emissions, preserving natural capital and preparing for the likely impact of climate change through shared global goals that increase humanity’s ability to limit and adapt to a changing climate.

Climate and natural capital is the sole pillar in which the majority of indicators rose across the entire period of 2012-2022, with sustained positive trends in financial commitments to mitigation and adaptation and a significant expansion of marine- protected areas. But, emissions continue to increase and progress toward ecological outcomes is stagnant (Figure 5).

2012-2022: Steady increase in commitments with rising emissions

global economy (by market capitalization) have set science-based targets for emissions reductions.26 Associated trade and investment also rose.

The period of 2012-2020 showed significant growth in financing commitments towards both climate mitigation and adaptation, with finance flows for mitigation nearly doubling and flows for adaptation rising by 56% as a share of GDP.

Net-zero commitments in the private sector have also proliferated, with groups such as Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), the Task Force of Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) growing in influence. Companies representing over 34% of the

On nature, advancement was mixed. More of the world became protected: the global percentage of marine protected areas increased by over 60%, while the share of terrestrial protected areas grew nearly 8% (from a considerably larger base) over the same time window. However, ocean health and biodiversity remained stable over this period, suggesting limited impact (to date) of these initiatives. This trend threatens the survival of one million species around the world,27 as well as the livelihoods of one in five people who rely on wild species for food and income.28

13

Despite progress on cooperative actions, real- world impact has not materialized at the same pace. Emissions intensity (emissions relative to GDP) improved over the decade (reducing at an average annual rate of 1.8%29), reflecting advances in electrification, decreases in heavy industry and increasing presence of renewable energy sources. However, the pace at which absolute emissions have risen has remained virtually unchanged over the past decade.

Bolstering cooperation to achieve interdependent climate objectives

Four interdependent objectives are required to achieve the net-zero transition: emissions reduction, affordability, reliability and industrial competitiveness.31 All four require a redoubling of efforts on international cooperation across both public and private sectors.

For many indicators, the years 2020-2022 either maintained prior trends or represented an uptick in progress. Mitigation financing grew by almost 14%; adaptation financing grew by over 13% (both as a percentage of GDP). There was continued focus on driving public commitments to low-carbon growth with a step-change in impact; the share of countries by GDP with long-term low-carbon development strategies grew from 15% in 2020 to 82% in 2022.30

However, the signs were not all positive in this period. While 2020 represented an anomaly in terms of emissions growth (falling by 3.5% given the pandemic-driven cessation in many core drivers of emissions), by 2021 emissions had retained their upward momentum and by 2022 they were 5.7% higher than 2020 and 2.4% higher than 2019.

To achieve these objectives, spending must be allocated effectively, focusing on creating incentives to deploy lower-cost solutions (e.g. solar/wind power) and reducing the costs of expensive solutions (e.g. passenger battery EVs; onshore wind power). At the same time, energy systems must be redesigned, with parties anticipating and removing bottlenecks for materials (e.g. lithium and nickel), land, infrastructure and labour. Energy markets and planning approaches for an electrified world also need to be prioritized (e.g. incentives for companies generating electricity to provide flexible capacity to support wind/solar transition). All of these efforts will demand greater collaborative action.

Pillar 4

Health and wellness"," How can international cooperation help address the challenges in climate, natural capital, health, and technology development highlighted in the given context, while minimizing potential risks such as concentration of innovation gains and ensuring a consistent global framework for generative AI?"," International cooperation can play a crucial role in addressing the challenges related to climate, natural capital, health, and technology development. Here's how:

1. Climate and Natural Capital: Cooperation can help countries coordinate their efforts in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, implementing sustainable practices, and preserving biodiversity. This can be achieved through international agreements like the Paris Agreement or the Convention on Biological Diversity. Additionally, joint initiatives to fund renewable energy projects and protect natural habitats can ensure a more equitable distribution of resources and benefits.

2. Health and Wellness: International cooperation is essential in addressing global health issues such as pandemics, tropical diseases, and maternal and child health. This can involve sharing research, resources, and best practices, as well as collaborating on the development and equitable distribution of vaccines and treatments.

3. Innovation and Technology: Cross-border cooperation is vital for technological advancement and addressing global challenges, such as climate change, healthcare, and economic development. This can include sharing research findings, collaborating on technological projects, and coordinating efforts to regulate emerging technologies like AI. To minimize the risk of concentration of innovation gains, international agreements could be established to ensure a level playing field for all countries and to promote open-source collaboration.

4. Peace and Security: International cooperation is necessary for maintaining peace and security globally. This can involve diplomatic efforts to resolve conflicts, collaborating on counterterrorism initiatives, and working together to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.

To ensure a consistent global framework for generative AI, international cooperation can help establish guidelines for ethical use, data protection, and accountability. This could involve creating an international body to oversee the development and implementation of these guidelines, ensuring that all nations are held to the same standards and that the benefits of AI are distributed equitably.

In conclusion, international cooperation is crucial in addressing global challenges while minimizing potential risks. By working together, countries can pool resources, share knowledge, and coordinate efforts to achieve common goals."

Pillar 4

Health and wellness

The health and wellness pillar examines the impact of global cooperation in enabling people worldwide to lead longer and healthier lives. The focus is on understanding the burden of disease on the duration and quality of life and the growing commitments to global public health standards and collaboration through flows of goods, R&D/IP and health financing.

Cooperation on health and wellness rose consistently from 2012 to 2020 and was essential in certain ways to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic, for example through the development of vaccines (though not their distribution). Since the peak in 2020, cooperation in these areas has declined slightly (Figure 6).

2012-2022: Steady growth and then a pandemic surge, with outcomes negatively impacted by COVID-19

Prior to 2020, most indicators of health cooperation – development assistance for health, trade in health goods, and flows of health-related R&D and IP – grew slowly and steadily. Health outcomes – life expectancy, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), maternal and child mortality – improved from 2012 through 2019, due in part to an increase in healthcare development aid and global efforts to address preventable and controllable diseases.

In 2020, cooperation in certain areas surged in response to the pandemic. Cross-border flows of pharma R&D/IP (as a share of GDP) nearly doubled. Development assistance for health jumped 40%. International scientists made the COVID-19 genome freely available, accelerating vaccine development, and health-related aid flowed to emerging economies. International agencies, such as Gavi, also played a pivotal role in providing basic life- saving vaccines.32

While there were major boosts to some aspects of global cooperation in reaction to the pandemic, other areas lagged significantly and, in some cases, reinforced existing inequities. Disparities in the distribution of vaccines33 and competition for scarce

15

The Global Cooperation Barometer 2024

resources like protective and testing equipment34 impeded collective resolution of the pandemic. There was a retrenchment in development assistance as a percentage of GDP of ~15% for health in 2021 (admittedly from the high watermark in 2020 as 2021 remained almost 25% higher than 2019).

in the pandemic longstanding institutions such as the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and the World Health Organization (WHO) saw their budgets rise by 15% from pre-COVID levels37 and continued growth in funding is needed. New mechanisms, like the G20’s $1.4 billion Pandemic Fund38 and the Partnerships for African Vaccine Manufacturing (PAVM), offer promising avenues for continued collaboration.39 The WHO’s Pandemic Preparedness Treaty (to be considered in 2024) is a prime example of international cooperation in progress, demonstrating how global leaders are working together to enhance pandemic prevention and response efforts through a comprehensive treaty framework.40

As the immediate impact of COVID-19 subsides, global health cooperation appears to be decreasing but remains above 2019 levels for certain metrics (e.g. reductions in child mortality continue). However, other metrics present a more mixed picture; overall life expectancy and DALYs35 suffered due to COVID-19-related deaths and the diversion of resources from other health priorities. Life expectancy at birth declined from 72.8 to 71.0 from 2019 to 2021. Malaria deaths rose by 10% from 2019 to 2020.36 And maternal mortality rates increased for the first time in three decades.

Beyond pandemic efforts, there are four broader areas where redoubling cooperation will be essential. International partnerships will play an integral role in coordinating and deepening basic research on a variety of health conditions, ranging from chronic disease to accelerating approaches to clinical trials on frontier conditions.41 Sustained cooperation is needed to tackle the continued proliferation of synthetic drugs globally (of which the UN Synthetic Drug Strategy in 2021 and the July 2023 launch of the Global Coalition to Address Synthetic Drug Threats42 are two prominent examples). There is significant potential to coordinate emerging best practices to support improved outcomes in mental health in the working- age population (e.g. approaches to support/leave for parents and caregivers).43 Finally, coordinated approaches are needed to engage and increase participation of ageing populations (where the global population of people over the age of 65 is forecast to reach 16.5% by 2050, up from 9.4% today).44

Redoubling efforts on pandemic- era cooperation and addressing chronic health and wellness challenges

National governments and private companies can learn from the instances in which resources and expertise were pooled during the pandemic. Many of the global health norms and infrastructure established during the pandemic (and before) can be preserved to support improved health outcomes and meet the test of future pandemics, aging populations, and chronic conditions. For example,

Pillar 5

Peace and security

The peace and security pillar looks at the impact of global cooperation in preventing and resolving conflicts. The focus is on the prevention of death and ameliorating the long-term negative implications of conflict through commitment to multilateral peacekeeping operations and international stabilization efforts.

Cooperation trends in peace and security demonstrated considerable decline starting in 2016 (Figure 7). This trend is driven by a rise in forcibly displaced people and cyberattacks, and a recent rise in the number of conflicts and conflict-related deaths, indicating an increasingly unstable global security environment and increased intensity of conflicts.

Outcome metrics"," Given the context provided, a simple question could be: ""How has global cooperation on health and wellness changed from 2012 to 2022, especially in response to the COVID-19 pandemic?"""," From 2012 to 2022, there has been significant growth in financing commitments towards health initiatives. However, the focus of this analysis is primarily on climate and nature-related metrics, so specific data regarding global cooperation on health and wellness, especially in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, might not be directly provided in the text.

To answer your question more specifically, it would be necessary to find additional resources or reports that focus on global cooperation on health and wellness during this timeframe, with a particular emphasis on the COVID-19 pandemic. Some potential areas to explore could include global vaccine distribution efforts, international funding for pandemic response, collaborative research initiatives, or policy coordination among nations to address the ongoing pandemic.

Some general observations can be made from the provided context: The growth in private sector commitments, such as GFANZ, TCFD, and SBTi, suggests an increased focus on addressing global challenges, which could include health crises like COVID-19. Additionally, the acceleration of digital transformation and investment in healthcare technology may also indicate a response to the pandemic, as these advancements can support remote healthcare services, contact tracing, and data analysis for disease surveillance and control."

Rising displacement and cyberattacks, sharp declines in peace and security

Although the number of global conflicts declined from approximately 18,000 in 2012 to 13,000 in 2020, suggesting that peace and security had improved, other indicators show a deteriorating landscape. Forcible displacement has grown markedly, with the number of forcibly displaced people nearly doubling between 2012 and 2020 (from 42 million to 82 million). Syria accounted for 24% of the additional 40 million people; Venezuela 12% and Yemen 8%.

A second development also lowered the score for global cooperation on peace and security – cyberspace became a new theater for conflicts. Between 2012 and 2020, significant cyberattacks45 quadrupled in number and became more costly. It is estimated that global cybercrime cost the world economy $1 trillion in 2020.46 Cyberattackers have reached across national borders to target space systems and other critical infrastructure, sent malware attacks against central private sector organizations (like oil companies47), conducted the first successful attack on a power grid,48 breached defenses at government agencies49 and attacked health system infrastructure.50

The devastating human costs of conflicts have grown immensely over the last two years. Though the level of conflict is similar to 2014, today’s battles are proving more deadly and destructive. In recent years, fatalities from conflict have risen dramatically to roughly 240,000 in 2022 – a nearly three-fold increase since 2020 and well above the previous peak of 150,000 in 2014. On average, deaths per conflict remained steady between 2012 and 2020 but have more than doubled since then.

In addition, global attempts at conflict resolution have not kept pace. The ratio of United Nations Security Council resolutions to the number of conflicts was 0.43:1 in 2020; that fell to 0.31:1 in 2022. Similarly, the ratio of peacekeeping operations to conflicts was 0.47:1 in 2020 and 0.36:1 in 2022.

Supporting vulnerable populations could start by addressing two critical needs. The first is managing the integration of refugee populations from conflict zones. For example, 58% of Ukraine’s 6.4 million refugees have now moved beyond Ukraine’s immediately neighbouring countries and may place strains on the social net or cohesion of Europe’s poorer countries if not integrated.53 The UN’s Regional Refugee Response Plan, a well-organized and rapidly scaled international humanitarian aid programme, provides an example of how to address critical immediate needs.54 Supporting leading practices in improving the integration of refugees in the medium term will be essential for allowing both refugees and host communities to benefit from these shifts,55 especially given tight labour market conditions in developed countries.

Forcible displacement also rose sharply in 2022, reaching a record for the period (of 2012-2022) at 108.4 million people,51 up from 89.3 million in 2021 (an increase of ~18%). More than 13 million people from Syria were displaced, as were 11.6 million from Ukraine and 10.2 million from Afghanistan.

In terms of cyberattacks, the number of significant cyberattacks remained stable from 2020 to 2022, at around 11.3 per month. However, in the context of the conflict in Ukraine, Russian attacks on Ukraine internet users rose by 250% and attacks on NATO countries by more than 300% in the same period, and these cyberattacks were coordinated with kinetic attacks to support ground efforts, representing a new twist in cyberwarfare.52

The second is identifying mechanisms and approaches that will support impacted individuals in conflict zones, particularly inflows of funds to support the provision of basic needs and reduce friction in aid flows without compromising compliance, security, and risk standards. This will require close collaboration between public sector approaches to financial crime regulation, private sector organizations with expertise in money transmission and the 10 million non-profit organizations who serve across a variety of needs.

Finally, given the evolving nature of cyberattacks and potential linkages to kinetic efforts, there is a need for redoubling cooperative efforts in the cyber domain, integrating public and private sector actors to boost sharing of data flows on cybersecurity threats, and identifying patterns of anomalous activity and new threat vectors.

Support for vulnerable populations and cyber collaboration

Given challenging trends in peace and security in the past decade, the public and private sectors should focus energies on supporting vulnerable populations and finding new mechanisms of collaboration to respond to the evolving challenge of cyberattacks.

Conclusion Towards a more cooperative future Even in today’s challenging geopolitical context leaders can take steps to forge greater cooperation.

In the context of the barometer findings, what can leaders in the public and private sectors do to protect their interests and help foster global cooperation?

Practice “coopetition” Amid an era of heightened geopolitical competition, parties should not take competition to mean cooperation is impossible, or that a decline in cooperation in one area means cooperation is impossible elsewhere. Instead, parties should focus on identifying avenues toward advancing shared interest that can exist despite competition – a practice known in the private sector as “coopetition”.56

role of their organization in supporting global cooperation in specific areas or with specific outcomes in mind. This may also require upgrading the board’s understanding given the complexities and nuances of these issues, drawing on the latest research and frameworks. Boards may want to invite global experts for regular sessions to discuss the latest developments, potential scenarios, and implications for the organization. Boards should also be more proactive in pressure- testing management on the potential controls or mitigations established to counteract the impact of declines in global cooperation.

Use cooperation to beget cooperation While cooperation can coexist with competition, cooperation can also be used to increase overall trust and diminish unnecessary rivalry or conflict. Parties should use instances of cooperation to not only advance interests in that area but also as an opportunity to explore other potential areas of alignment and to deepen trust with counterparts."," Based on the context provided, can you identify specific actions that leaders in both public and private sectors can take to foster global cooperation amidst the challenges in peace and security and cyberattacks over the next decade? And explain why these actions are important for addressing the issues highlighted in the text.

Answer:

1. Practice ""coopetition"": This strategy encourages parties to collaborate while also competing, acknowledging that competition does not necessarily preclude cooperation in other areas. By identifying shared interests and avenues for advancing them, even amidst geopolitical tensions, leaders can find opportunities for cooperation that benefit all parties involved.

2. Upgrade board understanding: Boards should invest in gaining a comprehensive understanding of the complexities and nuances surrounding global cooperation issues by inviting experts for regular sessions to discuss the latest developments, potential scenarios, and implications for their organization. This knowledge will enable them to make informed decisions that promote cooperation effectively.

3. Use cooperation to increase trust: Cooperation should not only serve to advance interests in a particular area but also as an opportunity to explore other potential areas of alignment and build trust with counterparts. Developing trust through successful collaborations can help reduce unnecessary rivalry or conflict in the long run.

These actions are essential for addressing the challenges highlighted in the text because they promote global cooperation among parties, which is crucial for addressing pressing issues such as conflicts, displacement, and cyberattacks. By fostering a spirit of collaboration and understanding, leaders can work together to find solutions that benefit all nations, ultimately creating a more secure and stable world.","1. Leaders in both public and private sectors should prioritize diplomatic initiatives aimed at resolving conflicts and preventing cyberattacks through open dialogue, negotiation, and the creation of international agreements. This requires a commitment to transparency, mutual understanding, and compromise among nations.

2. Encourage collaboration on cybersecurity research, development, and information sharing between governments, tech companies, and other relevant organizations. Sharing best practices, identifying vulnerabilities, and working together on solutions can help reduce the threat of cyberattacks and strengthen digital security worldwide.

3. Foster international cooperation on peacekeeping missions and conflict resolution efforts to address global hotspots and promote stability in fragile regions. This may involve coordinating military operations, humanitarian aid, and economic assistance, as well as diplomatic interventions to mediate disputes and prevent escalation of violence.

4. Develop partnerships between private sector companies to advance innovation and R&D in areas related to peacekeeping, conflict resolution, and cybersecurity. Collaborative projects can lead to the development of new technologies, tools, and strategies that help address these challenges more effectively.

5. Implement training programs for government officials and private sector leaders focused on conflict resolution, peacemaking, and digital security. These programs should equip participants with the skills, knowledge, and expertise necessary to navigate complex international situations and make informed decisions that promote global cooperation.

6. Establish multilateral forums for discussion and collaboration on peace and security issues, as well as cybersecurity concerns. Regular meetings between relevant parties can help maintain open lines of communication, share information, and collaborate on solutions to common challenges.

7. Encourage investment in social and economic development programs aimed at addressing root causes of conflict and promoting stability in fragile regions. This may involve providing aid for infrastructure projects, education initiatives, job creation programs, and other community-based efforts that help improve living conditions and foster long-term peace and prosperity.

These actions are important because they emphasize the need for collaboration and cooperation among nations to address pressing global challenges such as conflicts, cyberattacks, and instability in fragile regions. By working together, leaders can find solutions that benefit all parties involved and create a more secure and stable world."
"Raise the capabilities of management Every company, especially the largest multinationals, will be touched in some way by the ongoing mutations in globalization (including global trade flows).57 Cooperation needs to be treated like a muscle that can be strengthened and can react well in the face of geopolitical shocks. An understanding of both global connections and geopolitical realities – and implications for the business – should be a core competency for every multinational corporation C-suite executive.58 That means not just understanding the headlines, but having a subtle grasp of the nuances, context and potential implications for the business.

Evaluate board expertise and engagement In parallel with shifts in management, boards should be building their capabilities to conduct more nuanced discussions and decisions on topics of global cooperation, including the appropriate

Build dynamic strategic options The old paradigm of globalization largely depended on businesses shaping the way. Now governments are moving back into the lead, and this is likely to be a core consideration for every multinational. A starting point here will be a careful and clinical diagnostic of each firm’s interconnectedness – where, with whom, how – combined with a rigorous risk assessment of potential points of weakness. That understanding will form the basis for detailed scenario planning, including resilient alternatives for supply chains, and the elaboration of new strategy options that take into account dynamic world events.

Think diversifying, not decoupling Companies and countries that thoughtfully manage their concentrated exposures are likely to be more resilient – not only able to absorb a supply disruption, but also to bounce back better. There is already evidence of this in action: in April 2022, 81% of global supply-chain leaders surveyed said they had initiated dual sourcing of raw materials, up 26 percentage points from the previous year. Greater diversification not only strengthens resilience; it could also promote a more inclusive trading system and economy.59 The connection between trade and wealth creation is strong: diversification could enable more countries to participate more fully.

""Considering the trends in cross-border data flows, labor migration, IT goods and services trade, and remittances over the past decade, what are potential implications for global economic development, particularly in developing countries, in the next 5 years?"""," ""Given the trends observed in cross-border data flows, labor migration, IT goods and services trade, and remittances over the past decade, some potential implications for global economic development, particularly in developing countries, in the next 5 years could be increased foreign direct investment (FDI), improved technological innovation, enhanced workforce skills, and increased financial resources through remittances.

Increased cross-border data flows may lead to greater opportunities for knowledge transfer and technology diffusion, promoting innovative activities and productivity growth in developing countries. The growing number of labor migrants from these countries to developed economies might return with new skills and experiences that could further boost innovation and productivity.

The rising IT goods and services trade can provide lucrative export markets for developing countries, potentially leading to increased industrialization and economic diversification. Remittances sent by labor migrants to their home countries can contribute significantly to these economies' financial resources, improving living standards and fostering development projects such as infrastructure investments.

However, it is essential to consider potential challenges such as brain drain, unequal distribution of benefits, and the impact on social structures in developing countries. Addressing these issues will be crucial for maximizing the positive effects of global economic trends on their development."""
