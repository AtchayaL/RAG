Leaders in the public and private sectors will need to gain luency in the dynamics driving the changes to not just stabilize their position, but to be equipped to shape a beneficial future.\nIt is no secret that the current global context is concerning, as heightened competition and conflict appear to be replacing cooperation. The result is hat new power dynamics, changing demographic realities and breakthrough frontier technologies are raising the temperature on long-simmering distrust rather than fueling opportunities for benefit. Many businesses are responding to these complicated \u2014 and often fraught - geopolitical developments by shifting operations and facilities closer to home.\nYet, although the world is heading towards a dangerous divide by some measures, elsewhere there are prospects for and progress on cooperative arrangements. For instance, for the first time since countries began meeting to address global warming, an agreement was reached at the COP28 climate change conference on transitioning away from\nfossil fuels.\nThat cooperation and confrontation can coexist should not come as a surprise. History is replete with parties at odds with one another, but still\nBob Sternfels Global Managing Partner, McKinsey & Company\nseeking opportunities for collaboration. Notably, at the height of the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union coordinated on eradicating smallpox and addressing the ozone layer in the atmosphere. And many companies that compete with one another also find ways to cooperate in areas of mutual benefit.\nIt is within today\u2019s complex geopolitical context that gaining an understanding of the shape of global cooperation \u2014 and competition \u2014 is vital. Leaders\nin business and government will need to recognize where the contours of opposition end and those\nof alignment begin to navigate through the geopolitical turbulence and also to shape a more cooperative future.\nIt is for this reason that the World Economic\nForum and McKinsey & Company developed the Global Cooperation Barometer. The purpose of this analysis, which uses 42 indicators to measure the state of global cooperation broadly and along five areas, is to help stakeholders in business and government gain a better understanding of the nature of cooperation that is, or is not, taking place.\nOur hope is that the Global Cooperation Barometer will offer stakeholders a tool to use in shaping a healthier, more prosperous and more sustainable world in the year ahead and beyond.\nThe Global Cooperation Barometer 2024 3\nAbout the Global Cooperation Barometer\nThe Global Cooperation Barometer is structured along five dimensions of global connection: trade and capital, innovation and technology, climate and natural capital, health and wellness, and peace and security.\nThese five pillars were chosen because of their impact on global development and their explicit dependence on cooperative efforts among nations and economies. As a guiding element in the analysis, the barometer identified goals that actors are working toward in each of these themes. In doing so, the barometer draws inspiration from the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and the efforts of other global institutions.\nTo quantify change in these pillars, 42 indicators were identified that research suggests are either cooperative actions that advance progress on\nthe goals of the pillars or demonstrate a broad outcome from those actions. Cooperative action metrics measure actions that provide evidence of cooperation; these indicators (such as flows of goods and exchange of intellectual property) are evidence of\nThe Global Cooperation Barometer\u2019s 5 pillars of global cooperation\nTrade and capital Promote global development and resilience\nopportunities for these outcomes.\nInnovation and technology\nClimate and natural capital\nHealth and wellness\nPeace and security Prevent and resolve conflicts\nEnable global population to lead longer and better lives\nFocus of analysis is on i) impact of the burden of disease on duration and quality of life; through ii) commitment to global public health standards and collaboration through flows of goods, R&D/IP and health financing\nreal, manifested cooperation and do not include \u201con paper\u201d commitments. Outcome metrics (such as life expectancy) measure the progress of cooperation, but typically are influenced by additional factors beyond just cooperation. The metrics span countries in all geographies and all levels of development.\nThe barometer looks back at the last 11 years,\nfrom 2012 through 2022 to establish a trend line\nof cooperation. It indexes data to 2020 for the following reason: as the COVID-19 pandemic took hold, it accelerated many trends existing in business and society and set in motion many new ones. Indexing the time series to 2020 allows us to see what trends were in place before the pandemic, and the trends that emerged from it (without influencing or distorting the trends themselves). Note that some metrics have been inverted such that any increase represents a positive development.\nThe methodology used for the Global Cooperation Barometer is outlined below. Details on sourcing of individual metrics are in the Appendix.\nFocus of analysis is on i) development and resilient outcomes; through ii) presence of global economic flows that promote likely\nAccelerate innovation and beneficial technological progress"}, {"page_content": "Accelerate innovation and beneficial technological progress\nFocus of analysis is on i) global progress in innovation and technology; through ii) presence of the global sharing of underlying knowledge that contributes to these outcomes by fostering collaboration across global talent\nSupport the resolution of climate and natural capital challenges\nFocus of analysis is on i) lowering of emissions, preservation of natural capital, and preparedness for likely impact of climate change; through ii) shared global goals/commitments that increase humanity's ability to limit and adapt to the dynamics of a changing climate\nFocus of analysis is on i) prevention of death and long-term negative implications of conflict; through ii) commitment to multilateral peacekeeping operations and international stabilization efforts\nThe Global Cooperation Barometer 2024 4\nData coverage\n1. Geography\nAcross all metrics, the barometer aims to collect global data. In most cases, an aggregate global weighted average is available. When a global weighted average is not available, the most comprehensive data is used (e.g. OECD countries, or a sample set of countries where data is available for all years).\n2. Years\nWhile the barometer measures cooperation from 2012 through 2022, a few metrics do not have data for all years. All metrics have 2020 data to ensure the indexed trendline can be calculated.\nIndex calculation\nTo evaluate global cooperation fairly and compare trendlines of the action and outcome metrics across the five pillars, the global cooperation barometer applies the following methodology:\n1. Indexed trendlines\nData from 2020 serves as the base year to develop comparable trendlines, with all values in 2020 equal to 1 (2020=1). This base-year standardization is the basis of the score calculation, enabling a uniform reference point for all metrics and comparability, despite different units and datasets.\n2. Data normalization\nWhere possible, metrics are normalized to ensure that trendlines can be assessed independently of the effects of economic growth or population changes. For example, trade, capital, and other financial\nflows are normalized to global GDP, while migration metrics are normalized to global population levels.\n3. Weighting\nEach pillar comprises two indices: an action index and an outcome index. To arrive at each, the metrics within are weighted equally (i.e. the action index is a simple average of metrics measuring cooperative actions). The overall index for a pillar is calculated as an average of the action and outcome metrics. Aggregate indices across pillars are also calculated as a simple average of pillar indices (i.e. equal weighting across pillars).\nThe Global Cooperation Barometer 2024 5\nExecutive summary\nCooperation is multifaceted and can\ncoexist with competition.\nThe world is facing complex challenges. Addressing them demands cooperation at the global level.\nToday\u2019s economy is in a fragile state, with growth expected to be well below the historical average, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).' Revitalizing trade will be crucial to strengthening the economic outlook ahead and boosting livelihoods. However, the IMF has raised alarms about the possibility of global fragmentation, which could shave off 7% of global GDP?\nSimilarly, technological innovation is key to\nboosting currently sluggish productivity growth,\nwith generative artificial intelligence (Al) holding extraordinary potential - $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion\nin additional annual value across industries, as estimated by the McKinsey Global Institute.\u00b0 The only way to unlock this benefit and manage undesirable consequences is through global coordination.\nClimate change requires governments and businesses to work together to reach net zero, adapt to shifts in climate already locked in by previous emissions, and do all of this in a way that supports economic development across the globe. Just like the health of the planet, the health of people requires cooperation globally between governments and businesses. Long-term advancements in\nhealth and immediate responses to acute crises\nlike pandemics require parties around the world to work together. Yet, in terms of addressing the health and well-being of people and the planet, the world appears off course, with just 15% of the Sustainable Development Goals on track.*\nYet, as cooperation is becoming an imperative, the world order appears to be fragmenting. Indeed, the global security landscape \u2014 once a largely cooperative domain in the post-Cold War era \u2014 is deteriorating, with the United Nations noting at the start of 2023 that the world was witnessing the highest number of violent conflicts since World War IL.\u00b0\nThe Global Cooperation Barometer 2024 presents an approach to measure the current state of global cooperation. In doing so, the report is meant to serve as a tool for leaders to better understand the contours of cooperation broadly and along five pillars \u2014 trade and capital flows, innovation and technology, climate and natural capital, health and wellness, and peace and security.\nAfter trending positively for much of the past decade, global cooperation risks moving into reverse. The story varies by pillar:\n\u2014 Trade and capital: trade and capital cooperation grew through the pandemic disruption, but slowed in 2023; geopolitical tensions and new restrictions make the future path unclear.\n\u2014 Innovation and technology: flows of data, IP and international students powered an increase in cooperation until 2020, but new questions have arisen about how to work together to harness opportunities.\n\u2014 Climate and natural capital: the level of cooperation for climate and natural capital has been rising steadily, due in large measure to an increase in commitments, but emissions also continue to rise.\n\u2014 Health and wellness: cooperation in health and wellness rose swiftly in response to the pandemic, but appears to be settling back to historical patterns.\n\u2014 Peace and security: cooperation in peace and security has declined since 2016 and plummeted recently.\nBecause it is unlikely that the current geopolitical climate will change and competition and confrontation will soon cool, the barometer suggests that leaders in business and government should reimagine cooperation.\nThe barometer shows that cooperation is multifaceted, and elements of cooperation can coexist with elements of rivalry. Leaders can practice \u201ccoopetition\u201d - balancing cooperation\nand competition - to advance shared interests in specific areas, despite lack of alignment elsewhere. Further, leaders can use these instances of cooperation to build mutual trust, which in turn could strengthen cooperation in other areas.\nFundamentally, companies and countries should remember that cooperation breeds strength and resilience. Those that thoughtfully and constructively manage relationships bounce back better from challenges and achieve objectives.\u00ae\nThe Global Cooperation Barometer 2024 6\n@ Overall, the barometer indicates that\nafter trending positively for much of the past decade, global cooperation has been mildly reversing (down 2%) since 2020.\nIntroduction\nThe state of global\ncooperation\nMeasuring cooperation is a critical step in identifying ways to strengthening it.\nThe world is facing a plethora of challenges"}, {"page_content": "The world is facing a plethora of challenges\nthat require global cooperation to solve. Global temperatures shattered previous highs and last year was the hottest on record.\u2019 And, over 114 million people have been forcibly displaced worldwide \u2014 the highest level ever.\u00ae At the same time, ongoing threats of a pandemic and the risks of new, unregulated technologies warrant concern.\nCooperation is not only necessary as a reactive mechanism to address threatening global developments, but it is also needed to unlock\nnew opportunities. Indeed, generative Al has\nthe potential to contribute as much as $2.6\ntrillion to $4.4 trillion to the global economy, but requires substantial coordination across the global ecosystem to mitigate risks and ensure benefits are shared widely.\u00b0\nRecent history has shown that global cooperation can deliver profound benefits. During the first quarter-century after the end of the Cold War \u2014\na period largely seen as a high point for global cooperation \u2014 expanded trade lifted global incomes and as a result, the number of people living in extreme poverty was cut in half.'\u00b0 Instances of the international community reflexively coming together during this period are most evident through security coordination in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks, financial coordination in the wake of the global financial crisis in 2008, which included upgrading the G20, and global commitments to address the growing danger of climate change through the 2015 signing of the Paris Climate Agreement.\nBy many accounts, the geopolitical dial turned from cooperation to competition in the mid-2010s, as nationalist forces increased in many countries and protectionist policies rose.'' The dial then turned further away from cooperation as conflict broke\nout in Europe, Africa and the Middle East in recent years, with the UN warning in early 2023 that the world was witnessing the highest level of violent conflict since World War II.\"\nDespite the challenging context, the story about global cooperation is not black and white. Countries and companies can compete while also cooperating. Competition, and even confrontation, can spike in one area while cooperation can deepen in others. In a notable example, in 2022, amid eightened tensions between the United States and China, as climate negotiations between both countries were suspended and talk of decoupling dominated airwaves, bilateral trade reached record levels.\"\nTo help develop a better understanding of the current state of global cooperation, this report presents the Global Cooperation Barometer \u2014 a\nool that examines cooperation in five pillars: trade and capital, innovation and technology, climate and natural capital, health and wellness, and peace and security. The five pillars were chosen because, given the interconnected nature of the world, cooperation at the global level is necessary to see advancements in each of these areas.\nOverall, the barometer indicates that after trending positively for much of the past decade, global cooperation has been mildly reversing (down\n2%) since 2020 (Figure 1). The period from\n2012 to the pandemic was marked by increased cooperation across four of the five pillars (peace and security was the exception), led by innovation and technology\u2019s more than 30% increase in cooperation (Figure 2). However, in more recent years new questions have arisen about how to work together to harness opportunities that arise from innovation.\nThe Global Cooperation Barometer 2024 7\nFIGURE 1\nOverall global cooperation\nAverage index of cooperation metrics [2020=1]\n1A\n1.0\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\nOverall global cooperation\n2012 2013 2014\nSource: McKinsey & Company\nFIGURE 2\n2015 2016 2017 2018\n2019\nThe main drags on overall cooperation since 2020\nhave been declines in cooperation in the\nealth and\nwellness pillar and the peace and security pillar.

Rapid growth in technological streams such as intellectual property and data far outpaced growth in physical goods exchanges, '\u00ae with\nglobal data flows tripling and IT services trade doubling. At the same time, both the numbers\nof international students and cross-border R&D activity grew steadily.\n@ 2012-2020 @ 2020-2022\nStill, measuring how cooperation has contributed to developments in technology and innovation is complicated, but some metrics point to signs of cooperation. For example, the price of lithium-\nion battery cells, a critical component enabler for the energy transition, fell by 80%. The fall in cost reflected cooperation of countries across the global supply chain (e.g. basic research conducted in\nthe US and Japan; mass production capabilities in China, where 70%+ of global supply originates; and extraction of raw materials in Australia and Chile, among other countries).'\u00b0\nThe Global Cooperation Barometer 2024 11\nYet, total factor productivity (TFP; also called multifactor productivity), while not the only indicator of technological progress, is a useful measurement of overall innovation \u2014 it measures the ratio of overall output (GDP) to overall inputs, with innovation a\nkey factor in increasing the productivity level.2\u00b0 This metric remained virtually stagnant from 2012-2020,\naveraging -0.1% annual growth over the past\ndecade after a strong start o 0.4% in the early 2010s.\nSince the outset of the COVI in technology and innovation mixed.

And cross-border data flows declined by 2%."}, {"page_content": "Redoubling efforts to promote innovation through public and private sector partnerships\nGiven recent trends and the growing uncertainty over the continued path of equitable technological progress, global leaders will need to address (at least) two critical areas of cooperation.\nThe first is to commit to greater cross-border collaboration through foundational R&D, international student exchanges and cross-border patent applications. For example, the US and China collaborated on Al publications more than any other country pair from 2010 to 2021. The number of ublications grew roughly four-fold since 2010, but only 2.1% from 2020 to 2021.\u201d Broadening the otential base of collaborative networks (potentially hrough the continued expansion of universities in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) or increased ublic sector support of exchange programmes\nlor researchers) will be important to minimizing the otential for the gains of innovation and technology to ecome increasingly concentrated in fewer hands.\nThe second area is working to harmonize and simplify approaches to global regulation of frontier echnologies.

Companies representing over 34% of the\n@ 2012-2020 @ 2020-2022\nglobal economy (by market capitalization) have set science-based targets for emissions reductions.?\u00b0 Associated trade and investment also rose.\nOn nature, advancement was mixed. More of the world became protected: the global percentage of marine protected areas increased by over 60%, while the share of terrestrial protected areas grew nearly 8% (from a considerably larger base) over the same time window. However, ocean health and biodiversity remained stable over this period, suggesting limited impact (to date) of these initiatives. This trend threatens the survival of one million species around the world,?\u2019 as well as the livelihoods of one in five people who rely on wild species for food and income.?*\nThe Global Cooperation Barometer 2024 13\nDespite progress on cooperative actions, real- world impact has not materialized at the same pace. Emissions intensity (emissions relative to GDP) improved over the decade (reducing at an average annual rate of 1.8%79), reflecting advances in electrification, decreases in heavy industry and increasing presence of renewable energy sources. However, the pace at which absolute emissions have risen has remained virtually unchanged over the past decade.\nFor many indicators, the years 2020-2022 either maintained prior trends or represented an uptick in progress. Mitigation financing grew by almost 14%; adaptation financing grew by over 13% (both as a percentage of GDP). There was continued focus on driving public commitments to low-carbon growth with a step-change in impact; the share of countries by GDP with long-term low-carbon development strategies grew from 15% in 2020 to 82% in 2022.%\u00b0\nHowever, the signs were not all positive in this period. While 2020 represented an anomaly in terms of emissions growth (falling by 3.5% given the pandemic-driven cessation in many core drivers of emissions), by 2021 emissions had retained their upward momentum and by 2022 they were 5.7% higher than 2020 and 2.4% higher than 2019.\nBolstering cooperation to achieve interdependent climate objectives\nFour interdependent objectives are required\n\u20180 achieve the net-zero transition: emissions reduction, affordability, reliability and industrial competitiveness.*' All four require a redoubling of efforts on international cooperation across both ublic and private sectors.\nTo achieve these objectives, spending must be allocated effectively, focusing on creating incentives \u20180 deploy lower-cost solutions (e.g. solar/wind ower) and reducing the costs of expensive solutions (e.g. passenger battery EVs; onshore wind ower). At the same time, energy systems must be redesigned, with parties anticipating and removing ottlenecks for materials (e.g. lithium and nickel), land, infrastructure and labour. Energy markets and lanning approaches for an electrified world also need to be prioritized (e.g. incentives for companies generating electricity to provide flexible capacity to support wind/solar transition). All of these efforts will demand greater collaborative action.\nThe Global Cooperation Barometer 2024 14\nFIGURE 6\nIndex [2020=1]\n14\nHealth and wellness\nThe health and wellness pillar examines the\nimpact of global cooperation in enabling people worldwide to lead longer and healthier lives.

Health outcomes - life expectancy, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), maternal and child mortality \u2014 improved from\n2012 through 2019, due in part to an increase in healthcare development aid and global efforts to address preventable and controllable diseases.\n@ 2012-2020 @ 2020-2022\nIn 2020, cooperation in certain areas surged in response to the pandemic. Cross-border flows of pharma R&D/IP (as a share of GDP) nearly doubled. Development assistance for health jumped 40%. International scientists made the COVID-19 genome freely available, accelerating vaccine development, and health-related aid flowed to emerging economies. International agencies, such as Gavi, also played a pivotal role in providing basic life- saving vaccines.*\u00b0?\nWhile there were major boosts to some aspects\nof global cooperation in reaction to the pandemic, other areas lagged significantly and, in some cases, reinforced existing inequities. Disparities in the distribution of vaccines** and competition for scarce\nThe Global Cooperation Barometer 2024 15\nresources like protective and testing equipment** impeded collective resolution of the pandemic. There was a retrenchment in development assistance as a percentage of GDP of ~15% for health in 2021 (admittedly from the high watermark in 2020 as 2021 remained almost 25% higher\nhan 2019).\nAs the immediate impact of COVID-19 subsides, global health cooperation appears to be decreasing but remains above 2019 levels for certain metrics (e.g. reductions in child mortality continue). However, other metrics present a more mixed picture; overall life expectancy and DALYs\u00ae\u00ae suffered due to COVID-19-related deaths and the diversion of resources from other health priorities. Life expectancy at birth declined from 72.8 to 71.0 rom 2019 to 2021. Malaria deaths rose by 10% rom 2019 to 2020.%\u00b0 And maternal mortality rates increased for the first time in three decades.\nRedoubling efforts on pandemic- era cooperation and addressing chronic health and wellness challenges\nNational governments and private companies\ncan learn from the instances in which resources and expertise were pooled during the pandemic. Many of the global health norms and infrastructure established during the pandemic (and before) can be preserved to support improved health outcomes and meet the test of future pandemics, aging populations, and chronic conditions. For example,\nin the pandemic longstanding institutions such as the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and the World Health Organization (WHO) saw their budgets rise by 15% from pre-COVID levels\u00ae*\u2019 and continued growth in funding is needed. New mechanisms, like the G20\u2019s $1.4 billion Pandemic Fund* and the Partnerships for African Vaccine Manufacturing (PAVM), offer promising avenues for continued collaboration.*\u00b0 The WHO's Pandemic Preparedness Treaty (to be considered\nin 2024) is a prime example of international cooperation in progress, demonstrating how\nglobal leaders are working together to enhance pandemic prevention and response efforts through a comprehensive treaty framework.\u2019\u00b0\nBeyond pandemic efforts, there are four broader areas where redoubling cooperation will be essential. International partnerships will play an integral role in coordinating and deepening basic research on a variety of health conditions, ranging rom chronic disease to accelerating approaches 0 Clinical trials on frontier conditions.*' Sustained cooperation is needed to tackle the continued proliferation of synthetic drugs globally (of which he UN Synthetic Drug Strategy in 2021 and\nhe July 2023 launch of the Global Coalition\n\u2018o Address Synthetic Drug Threats\u201c are two prominent examples). There is significant potential \u20180 coordinate emerging best practices to support improved outcomes in mental health in the working- age population (e.g. approaches to support/leave for parents and caregivers).** Finally, coordinated approaches are needed to engage and increase participation of ageing populations (where the global population of people over the age of 65 is forecast 0 reach 16.5% by 2050, up from 9.4% today).\u201c*\ny\nPeace and security\n@Pillar 5)\nThe peace and security pillar looks at the impact\nof global cooperation in preventing and resolving conflicts.

Forcible displacement has grown markedly, with the number of forcibly displaced people nearly doubling between 2012 and 2020 (from 42 million to 82 million). Syria accounted for 24% of the additional 40 million people; Venezuela 12% and Yemen 8%."}, {"page_content": "Cooperation trends in peace and security demonstrated considerable decline starting in 2016 (Figure 7). This trend is driven by a rise in forcibly displaced people and cyberattacks, and a recent rise in the number of conflicts and conflict-related deaths, indicating an increasingly unstable global security environment and increased intensity of conflicts.\n60 -50 -40 -30 -20 -10 ie} 10\n@ 2012-2020 @ 2020-2022\nA second development also lowered the score\nfor global cooperation on peace and security \u2014 cyberspace became a new theater for conflicts. Between 2012 and 2020, significant cyberattacks\u2019\u00ae quadrupled in number and became more costly. It is estimated that global cybercrime cost the world economy $1 trillion in 2020.*\u00b0 Cyberattackers\nhave reached across national borders to target space systems and other critical infrastructure, sent malware attacks against central private sector organizations (like oil companies\u2019), conducted the first successful attack on a power grid,*\u00ae breached defenses at government agencies\u201c and attacked health system infrastructure.\u00b0\u00b0\nThe Global Cooperation Barometer 2024 17\nThe devastating human costs of conflicts have grown immensely over the last two years. Though the level of conflict is similar to 2014, today\u2019s battles are proving more deadly and destructive. In recent years, fatalities from conflict have risen dramatically to roughly 240,000 in 2022 \u2014 a nearly three-fold increase since 2020 and well above the previous peak of 150,000 in 2014. On average, deaths per conflict remained steady between 2012 and 2020 but have more than doubled since then.\nIn addition, global attempts at conflict resolution have not kept pace. The ratio of United Nations Security Council resolutions to the number of conflicts was 0.43:1 in 2020; that fell to 0.31:1 in 2022. Similarly, the ratio of peacekeeping operations to conflicts was 0.47:1 in 2020 and 0.36:1 in 2022.\nForcible displacement also rose sharply in 2022, reaching a record for the period (of 2012-2022) at 108.4 million people,\u00ae' up from 89.3 million in 2021 (an increase of ~18%). More than 13 million people from Syria were displaced, as were 11.6 million from Ukraine and 10.2 million from Afghanistan.\nIn terms of cyberattacks, the number of significant cyberattacks remained stable from 2020 to 2022, at around 11.3 per month. However, in the context of the conflict in Ukraine, Russian attacks on Ukraine internet users rose by 250% and attacks on NATO countries by more than 300% in the same period, and these cyberattacks were coordinated with kinetic attacks to support ground efforts, representing a new twist in cyberwarfare.\u00b0?\nSupport for vulnerable populations and cyber collaboration\nGiven challenging trends in peace and security in the past decade, the public and private sectors should focus energies on supporting vulnerable populations and finding new mechanisms of collaboration to respond to the evolving challenge of cyberattacks.\nSupporting vulnerable populations could start by\naddressing two critical needs. The first is managing the integration of refugee populations from conflict zones. For example, 58% of Ukraine's 6.4 million\nrefugees have now moved beyond Ukraine\u2019s immediately neighbouring countries and may place strains on the social net or cohesion of Europe\u2019s\npoorer countries if not integrated.** The UN's Regional Refugee Response Plan, a well-organized and rapidly scaled international humanitarian aid programme, provides an example of how to address critical immediate needs.** Supporting leading practices in improving the integration of refugees in the medium term will be essential for allowing both refugees and host communities to benefit from these shifts,\u00b0\u00b0 especially given tight labour market conditions in developed countries.\nThe second is identifying mechanisms and approaches that will support impacted individuals in conflict zones, particularly inflows of funds\nto support the provision of basic needs and reduce friction in aid flows without compromising compliance, security, and risk standards. This will require close collaboration between public sector approaches to financial crime regulation, private sector organizations with expertise in money transmission and the 10 million non-profit organizations who serve across a variety of needs.\nFinally, given the evolving nature of cyberattacks and potential linkages to kinetic efforts, there is a need for redoubling cooperative efforts in the cyber domain, integrating public and private sector actors 0 boost sharing of data flows on cybersecurity hreats, and identifying patterns of anomalous activity and new threat vectors.\nThe Global Cooperation Barometer 2024 18\nConclusion\nTowards a more cooperative future\nEven in today\u2019s challenging geopolitical context leaders can take steps to forge\ngreater cooperation.\nIn the context of the barometer findings, what can leaders in the public and private sectors do to protect their interests and help foster global cooperation?\nPractice \u201ccoopetition\u201d\nAmid an era of heightened geopolitical competition, parties should not take competition to mean cooperation is impossible, or that a decline in cooperation in one area means cooperation is impossible elsewhere. Instead, parties should focus on identifying avenues toward advancing shared interest that can exist despite competition \u2014a practice known in the private sector as \u201ccoopetition\u201d.\u00b0\u00b0\nUse cooperation to beget cooperation\nWhile cooperation can coexist with competition, cooperation can also be used to increase overall trust and diminish unnecessary rivalry or conflict. Parties should use instances of cooperation to not only advance interests in that area but also as an opportunity to explore other potential areas of alignment and to deepen trust with counterparts.\nRaise the capabilities of management\nEvery company, especially the largest multinationals, will be touched in some way by the ongoing mutations in globalization (including global trade flows).\u00b0\u201d Cooperation needs to be treated like a muscle that can be strengthened and can react well in the face of geopolitical shocks. An understanding of both global connections and geopolitical realities - and implications for the business \u2014 should be a core competency for every multinational corporation C-suite executive.\u00b0* That means not just understanding the headlines, but having a subtle grasp of the nuances, context and potential implications for the business.\nEvaluate board expertise and engagement\nIn parallel with shifts in management, boards should be building their capabilities to conduct more nuanced discussions and decisions on topics of global cooperation, including the appropriate\nrole of their organization in supporting global cooperation in specific areas or with specific outcomes in mind. This may also require upgrading the board\u2019s understanding given the complexities and nuances of these issues, drawing on the latest research and frameworks. Boards may want to invite global experts for regular sessions to discuss the latest developments, potential scenarios, and implications for the organization. Boards should also be more proactive in pressure- testing management on the potential controls or mitigations established to counteract the impact of declines in global cooperation.\nBuild dynamic strategic options"}, {"page_content": "Build dynamic strategic options\nThe old paradigm of globalization largely depended on businesses shaping the way. Now governments are moving back into the lead, and this is likely to be a core consideration for every multinational.\nA starting point here will be a careful and clinical diagnostic of each firm\u2019s interconnectedness \u2014 where, with whom, how \u2014 combined with a rigorous risk assessment of potential points of weakness. That understanding will form the basis for detailed scenario planning, including resilient alternatives for supply chains, and the elaboration of new strategy options that take into account dynamic world events.\nThink diversifying, not decoupling\nCompanies and countries that thoughtfully manage their concentrated exposures are likely to be more resilient \u2014 not only able to absorb a supply disruption, but also to bounce back better. There is already evidence of this in action: in April 2022, 81% of global supply-chain leaders surveyed said they had initiated dual sourcing of raw materials, up 26 percentage points from the previous\nyear. Greater diversification not only strengthens resilience; it could also promote a more inclusive trading system and economy.\u00b0? The connection between trade and wealth creation is strong: diversification could enable more countries to participate more fully.\nThe Global Cooperation Barometer 2024 19\nAppendix\nSources and methodology\nThe below text highlights two important features of the 42 indicators included in the barometer: their sources and the methodology used to construct global trendlines (if a transformation was applied),\norganized by pillar.\nTrade and capital\nGoods trade (as a % of GDP) Source: World Bank\nServices trade (as a % of GDP) Source: World Bank\nFDI stock (as a % of GDP) Source: United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)\nForeign portfolio investment (FPI) (as a % of GDP) Source: International Monetary Fund (IMF)\nMethodological notes: End-December holdings used for 2012; end-June holdings used for 2013-22 (due to data availability)\nODA (as a % of GDP)\nSource: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)\nMethodological notes: According to the OECD, prior to 2018, the ODA flows basis methodology covered loans expressed on a \u201ccash basis\u201d, meaning their full face value was included, then repayments were subtracted as they came in.
